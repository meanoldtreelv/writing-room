# Dungeon Lore

This story builds upon the idea outlined in the **_Battlemaster_** project with the addition of some themes as illustrated in Whatsawizzer's *My Dungeon Life*. Namely those of job/class switching as well as the whole concept of the Dungeon.

## Lore

Dungeons are caused by a curse, a story left unfinished. This is similar to the way a haunting or poltergeist is thought to occur, instead of an incorporeal instance forming a physical location. Within that location are monsters, bosses, traps, and treasures. However dying in the dungeon causes the soul to be consumed, never being able to be revived. The story of the dungeon seeks to come to a close. by helping the dungeon entities finish their story the curse can be completed. a completed dungeon grants blessings to those who finished the story.

## Tech note
this story is going to be crafted using the KoboldAI ML neural network then rewritten by the Ritr NN into readable prose.  

the KoboldAI NN should produce a fanfic quality story in terms of writing complexity and readability. it will need to be directed at the paragraph level to steer the story. 

once a chapter has been generated it will be imported to RITR and rewritten for tone tense añd p3rspect8ve 

## Fleshing out the world 
prior to writing the main novel a series of vingettes will be created based on appropriate writing prompts.  the charactwrs and events that appear in the vingettes may or may not appear in the final story.  

### Some key concepts in this world:

- resurrection is easy, if you can afford it
- jobs give skills but do not equal skill
- jobs cant be changed easily.
- *you can only have one job at a time*
- sometimes selling yourself is the only way to get by
- some people treat slaves as "involuntary family memebers"
- humans are the minority.
- dwarves are lolis.(stealing this)
- dungeons create life?
- humans are a ruliñg class and not common amonst the pesant races. 

## SOME SCRIBBLED NOTES:
----
### EXISTENTIALISM
there are 6 "attributes"

2 neutral
- body
- soul

2 Light aligned:
- spirit
- mana

2 Dark aligned
- karma
- miasma

Light and Dark are in direct opposition to each other. miasma will corrupt mana, while mana can burn out miasma. spirit is the power of the soul that can be overcome by karma, a strong enough spirit can break free from karmic bounds.

generally people only think about the combination of body, mana, and spirit. "Light" aligned classes/races use these as resources. Body for physical toughness and strength. mana to power spellcasting, spirit for healing and mental conditioning (confusion, sleep, etc).

It is generally believed that only one body may exist at a time for a given soul. Upon resurrection the body will rapidly dissolve into its base components. that is generally taught to be the Mana and Spirit leaving the corporeal form and joining with the soul to form a new body.
    
Soul is an attribute that is hard to codify.Many believe that it is the essence of an individual. a collection of their memories and experiences. This collection can be damaged by the death of the body.

*as a generalization: the soul holds the essence of an individual, it is contained within the body that is created by mana/miasma and sealed inside with spirit/karma.*
    
### JOBS

everyone is born with a job assigned to them, it's usually something along the lines of "Commoner", or if they happen to have peerage, the station they are born into "Noble" or similar. These jobs provide some of the most basic active skills a person needs to exist such as *basic cooking*, *basic mending*, etc. 

By performing tasks and taking actions favored by certain professions one can unlock the corresponding job. Without intervention the job with the hughest level is the one that is equipped. Certain classes have the ability to change others jobs, however onve changed gaining a level in a higher leveled job will cause it to equip. 

as an example: a level 5 bandit has unloced the merchannt class at level 1, they have heir job changed to merchant and proceed to act the part, raising Merchant to level 4. on the road between towns they happen across some unsuspecting folks and old tendancues rear their head. by robbing the people on he road our merchant gains a level in bandit, changing their primary job and losing all their merchant skills. 

a perosns currently equipped job is also inportant, as when inspected by the *identify* skill only the active job is shown, effectively hiding a pwesons past unless they consent to a more in-depth search.

### SOCIETY

The world that the protag gets sent to is a neo-feudal society. Countries usually followed the division of a set of "High Lords" and "Low Lords", Noble ranks are typically Duke, Count, Marquis, Viscount, Baron, Baronet. 

High Lords are genrally the Duchal familys, including that of the nation's Soverign. The Duchal families are interwoven with eachother and the Soverign line through a complex series of marriages. 

```
A quick note on what exatly is a Duke, and what about a "Duchy" or "Dukedom". 

When considering a nation it is generally made up of a series of provinces. Each province would be controlled by the family of the Duke. They serve as the main military commander for their province, and act as the lige lord for all of the Minor Nobles within that province. 
```

Low Lords make up the bulk of the peerage, and jave a complex tiering structure.

The Count/Earl control the next building block, the county. Counties serve as administrative districts within a province. There exists a special type of county, known as a march, this is controlled not by a Count, but by a Marquis. Marches form the outer boundaries of a province against wilderness or neighboring countries, as such they are generally a lot more martial focused than normal counties. Depending on the country, the Marquis can be seen as having either a higher or lower position of peerage relaive to the Count. Some see them as staunch defenders, others as barbaric border lords. 

The next step down from the county is the Barony. Here is where things start breaking up. While A Duchy is divided into counties, Baronies exist within the county but do not nessacarily fill the entire county. Meaning that one can leave a Baron's territory but not nessacry enter that of another Baron. Baronies are a herediarty grant of land from the Count/Marquis, in exchange for the Baron serving as an intermediate layer of administration. 

```
But what about the Viscount and Baronet?

The Viscount is a non-landed title of peerage, above the Baron but below the Count/Marquis. Viscounts are individuals who have been raised to the peerage and the title is not inherited. This could be a commoner whome the nobility wished to grant peerage too, but not a land allotment. Or a non-heir to a count/marquis that should be recognised as a peer due to thier personal achivements. 

A Baronet is not considered a Peer, but they are a member of Nobility. Baronets are individuals or familys that have been given rule over a specific area of a barony. Occasionaly they are known as "Manor Lords" as their area of influecene does not extend much farther than the town surrounding their Manor. 
```
To recap: Duchies make up the countries provinces, and are divided into counties for administrative purposes. Counties contain Baronies who act as an extra layer of administration. Baronies can contain Baronets to keep adding layers on, but they are not peers. Viscounts are between Counts/Marquis and Barons, but don't control any land.  

### Slavery

Slavery plays a big part in this world. 

#### Becoming A Slave
The second most common way someone becomes a slave is because they were unable to cover their debts. The most common way is to have a parent who failed to do so. Once someone is branded as a slave they are legally considered property, and anything they create is owned by thier master, including any children they produce. A third common way to become a slave is as punishment for a crime, this type of slave cannot be freed and is under a very strict brand. 

#### Freeing A Slave
Some sensabilities object to slavery on principal and wish to set slaves free. There are legal methods to do so as outlined by the Guild of Indenturement. 

If the person to be freed was made a slave due to debt, those debts must be cleared, a fee paid to the guild for administrative processing, and the costs to have the brand broken. The fees and costs are generally around the amount of money earned by a peasant in a decade, thus restricting freedom to the wealthy and noble classes. 

If the person was born a slave the process is significantly more arduous. The administrative fees and ritual costs are the same, however upon being granted freedom the former slave does not have any form of nationality, and must proceed through the proper channels to be granted citizenship of their country of residence. Some countries make this process easy, some near impossible. 

#### Brands

There are several types of slave brands that can be placed upon a slave. While binding they can be changed to a different type by the salves master through the guild. 

Slave brand types: 
- mandatum - command - The Mandatum brand allows the slave to act with near free will, however it will force them to obey specific direct orders. This brand is only seldom used as it gives near complete autonomy to a slave. 
- potestas - control - The Potestas brand is the most common household slave brand. Once given an order the slave is compelled to complete the task as instructed, if the task was nonspecific they are allowed to use some judgement in its completion. This brand also provides a minor form of compulsion making the slave more docile. Disobeying an order will result in a mental pain stimulation. 
- obsequium - obediance - the Obsequim brand is usually given to unruly or criminal slaves. It removes the ability to use thier own judgement in executing an order and must follow instructions as given. This brand will also activate and provide an extra dose of compulsion to obey should the slaves emotions become elevated. Disobeying an order will result in a breif debilitating physical pain stimulation. 
- mancupium - thrall - The Mancupium brand is one of the strongest brand forms. It effectively removes free will from the slave, punishing them severely with mental and physical pain if they attempt to disobey. Rather than mental compulsion, this brand activates a severe Physical and mental pain response any time the slave tries to circumvent or disobey a direct or implied order. This response is several orders of magnitude stronger and longer than other brands. These slaves are quickly turned into mindless machines from the constant mental exhaustion and pain. 

In addition to the brand on the slave, a slave master also recieves a brand. Though this brand is normally significantly smaller and is usually hidden. The Master brand acts as an anchor point for the slave brand enchantment to be anchored to. There are two basic types of Master brand, Transitory and Familial. 

The Familial brand is preferred by noble houses, as it allows a slave to be transferred between Masters with the same brand. On the death of the current master any slaves that have been bound will transfer to the nearest familial brand holder. When aquired slaves are registered to the family as a whole instead of an individual

Transitory brands restrict the ownership of a slave to a particular master, and require that the Guild be involved to move the slave from one master to another. On the death of the master the slaves bond will transfer to a specified individual at the guild, who will transfer the slave to an appointed individual, or compensate the decesased's estate after selling the slave. 

#### Control

There are several ways to control slaves, the most common being the brand as detailed above. Additionally an enchanted item known as the Slave Collar is avalible from the guild. This collar can be placed on anyone who is not branded as a slave or master to grant the same effects as the Obsequim brand. The slave colllar has a leash and bracelet that must be affixed to someone's wrist at all times for the control to be active. 

When giving orders to a slave it is important to be direct, provide all the nessacary details, and ensure the order is achievable.
