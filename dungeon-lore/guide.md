# Dungeon Lore

This story builds upon the idea outlined in the **_Battlemaster_** project with the addition of some themes as illsutraded in Whatawizzer's *My Dungeon Life*. Namely those of job/class switching as well as the whole concept of the Dungeon. 

Dungeons are caused by a curse, a story left unfinsihed. This is similar to the way a haunting or poltergeist is thought to occour.instead of an incorporeal instance forming a physical location manifests. Within that location are monsters, bosses, traps, and treasures. However dying in the dungeon causes the soul to be consumed, never being able to be revivived. the story of the dungeon seeks to come to a close. by helping the dungeon entities finish their story the curse can be completed. a completed dungeon grants blessings to those who finished the story. 

Some key concepts in this world:

- ressurection is easy, if you can afford it
- jobs give skills but do not equal skill
- jobs cant be changed easily.
- *you can only have one job at a time*
- sometimes selling yourself is the only way to get by
- some people treat slaves as "involuntary family memebrrs"
- humans are the minority.
- dwarves are lolis.(stealing this)
- dungeons ceeare life 

## some scribbled notes:

### existentialism 
there are 6 "attributess"
2 neutral
- body
- soul
2 Light aligned:
- spirit
- mana
2 Dark aligned
- karma
- miasma

Light ans Dark are in direct opposition to eachother. miasma will corrupt mana, while mana can burn out miasma. spirit is the power of rhe soul that can be overcome by karma, a stong enough sprit can break free from karmic bounds.

generally people only think about the combinatoon of body, mana, and spirit. "Light" aligned classes use these as resources. Body for physical toughness and strength. mana to power spellcasting, spirit for healing and mental conditioning (confusion, sleep, etc). 

it is generally beleived that only one body may exist at a time for a given soul. Upon ressurection the body will rspidly dissolve into its base components. that is generally taught to be the Mana and Spirit leaving the coporeal form and joining with the soul to form a new body.
    
soul is an attribute that is hard to codify.many believe that is is the essence of an individual. a collection of their memories and experiences. This collection can be damaged by the death of the body.

as a generalization: the soul holds the essence of an individual, it is contained within the body that is created by mana/miasma and sealed inside whith spirit/karma. 
    
### jobs

everyone is born with a job assigned to them, its ususally something along the lines of "Commoner", or if they happen to have peerage, the station they are born into "Noble", "Count", "Dutchess", etc. these jobs provide some of the most basic active skills a person needs to exist.

By performing tasks and taking actions fsvored by a. certain professikn one can unlock the corrosponding job. equipping that job allows you to gain new skills.
