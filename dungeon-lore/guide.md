# Dungeon Lore

This story builds upon the idea outlined in the **_Battlemaster_** project with the addition of some themes as illustrated in Whatawizzer's *My Dungeon Life*. Namely those of job/class switching as well as the whole concept of the Dungeon.

## Lore

Dungeons are caused by a curse, a story left unfinished. This is similar to the way a haunting or poltergeist is thought to occur, instead of an incorporeal instance forming a physical location. Within that location are monsters, bosses, traps, and treasures. However dying in the dungeon causes the soul to be consumed, never being able to be revived. The story of the dungeon seeks to come to a close. by helping the dungeon entities finish their story the curse can be completed. a completed dungeon grants blessings to those who finished the story.

### Some key concepts in this world:

- resurrection is easy, if you can afford it
- jobs give skills but do not equal skill
- jobs cant be changed easily.
- *you can only have one job at a time*
- sometimes selling yourself is the only way to get by
- some people treat slaves as "involuntary family memebers"
- humans are the minority.
- dwarves are lolis.(stealing this)
- dungeons create life

## SOME SCRIBBLED NOTES:
----
### EXISTENTIALISM
there are 6 "attributes"

2 neutral
- body
- soul

2 Light aligned:
- spirit
- mana

2 Dark aligned
- karma
- miasma

Light and Dark are in direct opposition to each other. miasma will corrupt mana, while mana can burn out miasma. spirit is the power of the soul that can be overcome by karma, a strong enough spirit can break free from karmic bounds.

generally people only think about the combination of body, mana, and spirit. "Light" aligned classes use these as resources. Body for physical toughness and strength. mana to power spellcasting, spirit for healing and mental conditioning (confusion, sleep, etc).

It is generally believed that only one body may exist at a time for a given soul. Upon resurrection the body will rapidly dissolve into its base components. that is generally taught to be the Mana and Spirit leaving the corporeal form and joining with the soul to form a new body.
    
Soul is an attribute that is hard to codify.Many believe that it is the essence of an individual. a collection of their memories and experiences. This collection can be damaged by the death of the body.

*as a generalization: the soul holds the essence of an individual, it is contained within the body that is created by mana/miasma and sealed inside with spirit/karma.*
    
### JOBS

everyone is born with a job assigned to them, it's usually something along the lines of "Commoner", or if they happen to have peerage, the station they are born into "Noble", "Count", "Dutchess", etc. these jobs provide some of the most basic active skills a person needs to exist.

By performing tasks and taking actions favored by a. in certain professions one can unlock the corresponding job. equipping that job allows you to gain new skills.

### SOCIETY

The world that the protag gets sent to is a neo-feudal society.
