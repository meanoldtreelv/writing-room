# writing-room
this repo is to serve as a brainstorming and project dump for fiction projects. codebase is going to be mixed html and markdown.

index.html is to serve as a jumping off point that will serve links inward to each project.

within the project the following structure will be presented:

guide.html
  this file will have links to subfolders and directories as well as a brief synopsis
/refs/
  this folder contains reference imagery for characters locations and concepts
/chars/
  this folder contains character information

  /cast.html
    this file contains links to each character subpage, a brief description, and the relationship web

  /$CHARNAME.html
    each character has their own document to detail information. these are broken into several sections: bio, motivations, relationships, secrets, timeline

/locations/
  this folder contains detailed information on world locations following an organized hierarchy.

  /map.html
    this file contains charts and brief descriptions of locations that need to be tracked.

  /$PlANE/$REGION/$SUBREGION/$LOCALE.html
