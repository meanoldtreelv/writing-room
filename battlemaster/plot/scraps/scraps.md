This is one of the main revolving points in the story. PT gains a limited amount of {currency} that can be used in exchange for different possessed items.

## Minted Coin
Coinage may very from kingdom to kingdom, but all follow the same basic structure

```
50 Small Copper Coins > 1 Large Copper Coin
2 Large Copper Coins > 1 Small Silver Coin
50 Small Silver Coins > 1 Large Silver Coin
2 Large Silver Coins > 1 Small Gold Coin
50 Small Gold Coins > 1 Large Gold Coin
2 Large Gold Coins > 1 Small Platinum Coin
50 Small Platinum Coins > 1 Large Platinum Coin
```



This effectively reduces down to a base100 monetary system with a half step denomination. 
ie. Your change is one small gold coin, 1 large silver coin, 23 small silver coins, and 69 small copper coins or $173.69

some countries may not use the large coin denominations, or have different names for each of their coins, however the monitary exchange stays the same. 

in system it should be displayed as :

|G: 1 S: 73 C:69|
