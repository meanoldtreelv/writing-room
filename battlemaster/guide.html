<p>
  This series is going to rely very hevily on the Monster Girl Encyclopedia to flesh out the races of the world, gone are the generic catgirls.
Also of note this series is not going to pull any punches. The world is a harsh place, and the law of kill or be killed is an everyday fact of life. <strong> Be warned ahead lies killing, fucking, and people with broken moral compasses. </strong>

<p>
Procedure Note: This series is going to make use of the "bluebox" convention from RoyalRoad for system messages, this means that each chapter will have to be reformatted for posting on other sites such as reddit. Tables can be converted from html to markdown using the tool located at <a href="http://tableit.net/">http://tableit.net/</a>
